# Book-Recommendations-from-Charles-Darwin
Build a book recommendation system using NLP and the text of books like "On the Origin of Species."

## Project Description
Recommendation systems are at the heart of many products such as Netflix or Amazon. They generally rely on metadata (e.g., the actors or director of a movie) or on user tastes (e.g., the movies you liked before) to determine which you are most likely to enjoy. But when you are working with text-heavy datasets, you have access to a much richer resourceâ€”the whole text! In this project, you will learn how to build the basis of a book recommendation system based on their content. You will use Charles Darwin's bibliography to find out which books might interest you.

The dataset was manually collected from Project [Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
